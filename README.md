My exploratory microservices plateform, following great presentation from the excellent Josh Long (https://github.com/joshlong)

# Microservices with SpringBoot, SpringCloud etc..

The goal : 
Build a reservation platform using microservices : Sprinboot REST API, JPA, Web (MVC), H2 db, HATEAOS

But also a whole bunch of great tehcnologiy from SpringCloud and Netflix microservices stack (quite standards now)
- Centralized Configuration server (wich is a microservice itself)
- Eureka integration for service discovery
